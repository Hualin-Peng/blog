We've launched the second issue of `Fait Main <http://faitmain.org>`_, a
French magazine about the DIY movement. There are a lot of rough edges
remaining since the magazine is built on our week-ends, but it's starting
to look good. I love the content of the second issue because it talks about
very different topics and not only the usual suspects (Python, Raspberry-PI,
Arduino.)

One thing I want to mention to all my English speaking friends:
**we also accept articles in English - we take care of the translation**.

This issue has two articles that were originally in English:

- `How to open a microchip <http://faitmain.org/volume-2/ouvrir-puce.html>`_
- `Levees monitoring in Holland <http://faitmain.org/volume-2/surveillance-digues.html>`_

The first one appeared on my radar in Hacker News, and I asked the author
the permission to translate it and publish it in the magazine. The second one
was written by a member of the Python community,
`Fritz van Deventer <http://faitmain.org/auteurs/fritz_van_deventer.html>`_ I
met during the FOSDEM in a corridor session. I was impressed by his work
and asked him to write a little article for our magazine.

So, if you want to write something for the third issue, or know a great
article we should translate - let me know in the comments.

Issue #3 will be out in August.
