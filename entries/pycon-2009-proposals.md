Title: Pycon 2009 proposals

The proposal acceptance date is in a few days.   
  
Here are the four proposals I have made:   
-   **The state of packaging in Python**. This discussion resumes the
    current options when it comes to distribute your packages. It also
    explains the pitfalls and the gap between the Python developers and
    the OS vendors and packagers. I think this talk will not be picked
    because the topic is wide and vague. So I proposed to transform it
    into a panel where lead developers from various framework could
    explain their usage of distutils and what is missing to make them
    happy. No feedback yet on this.
-   **Atomisator, the agile data processing framework**. This tool is
    starting to be useful, and I think it can be useful to others. Check
    [http://atomisator.ziade.org][] for a quick overview.
-   **How AlterWay releases web applications using zc.buildout**. That
    is the same talk I gave at the Plone conf but I present it in a way
    people understand zc.buildout is not tied to Zope and Plone and can
    be used with any other application. As a matter of fact, it has
    become a standard here, and we use it for Pylons, etc..
-   **On the importance of PyPI in delivering and building Python
    softwares - mirroring, fail-over and third-party package indexes**.
    That's a long title. It presents [my work on PyPI][].

  
Last, I will go to the Python Language Summit the day before Pycon. I
volunteered to be a "champion" on distutils matters.
