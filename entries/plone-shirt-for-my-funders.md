So I promised I would create a shirt for the top \#5 contributors of my
fund raising.   
  
I think I found an idea. [My friend JJ is wearing a shirt][] I made on
the picture you see. That's the phrase we wanted me to put on the shirt:
  
> **There's no place like 127.0.0.1 **   
>    
>  **(except maybe ::1)**

  
That is one of the geekiest shirt I know of :D   
  
Anyway, I want to borrow the idea for the plone shirt, and write,
beside the Plone logo:   
> **There's no place like 127.0.0.1 **   
>    
>  **(except maybe \#plone on freenode)**

  
That is, to express the fact that the Plone community is a really
friendly one, and it's great to be part of it.   
  
EDIT: I have better proposals from the two Alex:   
> **$ whois plone**   
>    
>  **127.0.0.1**

  
and:   
> **There is no place like Plone**

  
and:   
> **Plone, I wish I knew how to quit you**

  
and:   
> **Did you mean Plone ?**

  
I am hesitating now.... :)
