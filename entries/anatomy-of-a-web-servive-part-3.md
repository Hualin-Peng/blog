Title: Anatomy of a web service -- Part 3

I am pursuing the RedBarrel experiment, mainly by writing some
documentation to show how things work.   
  
If you don't recall what I am talking about, read back the two previous
blog entries:   
-   [Anatomy of a Web Service -- part 1][]
-   [Anatomy of a Web Service -- part 2   
   ][]

  
I added a full demo in the documentation, that explains how to write an
URL shortener Web Service with RedBarrel (don't look at the code itself
-- it's irrelevant)[:
http://redbarrel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/demo/][]   
  
If you happen to have some web services based on Pylons, Pyramid or
anything on the top of WebOb, I'd be very happy to try to refactor them
using RedBarrel as an experiment, to see how things work out. (not for
you to use, but just for me to exercise the idea)
