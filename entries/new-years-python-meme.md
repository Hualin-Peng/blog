Here's a short, 5 questions, 2009 Python meme. Copy-paste the questions,
and blog your answers !**   
**   
  
**1. What's the coolest Python application, framework or library you
have discovered in 2009 ?**   
  
**Twisted**. I have used Twisted in small occasions in the past, but
since I have changed my job, a fair amount of my daily work is around
the Twisted framework. I also program in plain Python for some needs,
and I use Pylons to build our website, but Twisted is the biggest part
of our current application.   
  
**2. What new programming technique did you learn in 2009 ?**   
  
**Network programming**. I was a web programmer before, and now I am
learning how to write programs that need to scale, to work using several
computers. It's pretty exciting, and sometimes pretty exhaustive because
when some bugs occur, they are often leading to [snowball effects][].
The code needs to be more rigourous, and I need to know exactly what is
going on when interacting with memory or I/O.   
  
**3. What's the name of the open source project you contributed the
most in 2009 ? What did you do ?   
**   
  
**Python**. I am a commiter since December 24th 2008 (my birthday ;) ).
And I have been working almost exclusively on Distutils. I did around
200 commits in the trunk (not counting the backports and forwardports on
the branches), and I have been mainly correcting bugs and improving
Distutils code coverage, which I raised from 18% to up to 75%.   
  
I have also added some minor new features. The most important ones are
or will be added in the What's new file hopefully. I also did a lot of
work in the PEPs to prepare the future of packaging in Python, and wait
for that work to be finished, to start to change Distutils more. While I
did more commits in Distribute, Distutils was the most time-consuming
project.   
  
**4. What was the Python blog or website you read the most in 2009 ?**
  
  
Python Reddit. And I think I am not alone in that case. 90% of my blog
hits come from Reddit :-)   
  
**5. What are the three top things you want to learn in 2010 ?**   
  
I'd like to learn **how to program the C part of the CPython core**,
and eventually to try to contribute some patches for CPython. I would
also like to **write my own toy programming language**, just for fun.
Last, I would like to **learn Japanese**. And all this comes after
Distutils, Distribute, etc, so I am pretty sure I won't find the time...
