I have sent a [proposal for a tutorial][] at Pycon, covering the way to
document a project through the developement cycle. It's based on [Agile
Documentation principles][] and provide a way to smoothly integrate
documentation in the daily developer work.   
  
Here it is:   
> ***Summary ***   
>    
>  *Documentation plays a vital role in open sources projects.*   
>    
>  *Well designed, it attracts new people into the project,   
>  help the users use it, and raises the quality   
>  of the code base and the team work.*   
>    
>  *In other words, it builds the shared knowledge.*   
>    
>  *This tutorial is based on a talk i've made   
>  at Europython about [zope-cookbook.org][], and go   
>  further by giving a complete set of practical methods   
>  that can help a team to create and maintain an up to date   
>  documentation with no pain.*   
>    
>  *An example code base will be provided and used for all   
>  exercises.*   
>    
>  *By the end of the tutorial, people should be able to   
>  integrate documentation in their developement process,   
>  the same way they probably did one day with unit testing.   
>  **   
>  Presentation outline***   
> -   *agile documentation principle (short overview)*
> -   *mastering doctests (overview + exercises)*
> -   *mastering reStructuredText (overview + exercises)*
> -   *writing techniques and tips (examples + exercises)*
> -   *shapes of documents (overview)*
> -   *building document templates (examples + exercises)*
> -   *setting up documentation writing in the development cycle:*
> -   *continuous documentation (examples + exercises)*
> -   *team writing (exercises)*
> -   *portfolio (overview)*
> -   *setting up a help center (overview + exercise)*
> -   *linking it all together (complete example
>     (svn/trac/website/etc..))*
>
>   
>  *\* Intended audience*   
>    
>  *All, except the doctests exercises that will have a bit of coding*   
>    
>  *the zope-cookbook talk:   
>  -
