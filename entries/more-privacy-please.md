Title: More privacy please

It became extremely annoying for me to get targeted ads, since I do most
of my shopping online, even groceries. I am a great target for
advertising operators :)   
  
Google seems to be very transparent about letting you opt-out third
party cookies as a logged-in user, there's a page for this [here][]. You
can also make sure your web history is disabled on [this page][].

But I don't want to chase options on every online service I use, just
to opt-out and protect my privacy. All these options should be off by
default in my opinion, or at least you should be warned, no ? I don't
know if it's still accurate but there's [a law in Europe][] for this.   
  
Anyways, this is not a new problem. But I realized that while I was
shocked by how cookies could breach your privacy +10 years ago, I was
not taking any action to protect myself. Let's fix this.   
  
I am trying to fine-tune my browser and change my search habits to make
sure I am leaking as less data as possible.   
  
Here's a list of actions I have done, if you have better ideas please
comment, I'll try to keep that list up-to-date.   
-   Use Firefox and [disable third-party cookies][].
-   Activate [Do Not Track][] - there's now [a good list of ads
    companies][] that should honor it.
-   Install [Cookie Monster][] to get more control on cookies.
-   Install the [Ghostery plugin][]to detect and block ads scripts. It's
    pretty enlightening.
-   Install [HTTPS Everywhere][]. (nothing really a counter-measure for
    data leaking but it's safer - use it!)

  
I have also decided to give a shot to [duckduckgo.com][] instead of
google.com for search.[They don't track][] at all. You can[install the
ssl search bar add-on][] and also [tweak your Awesome bar][] so it uses
it too (I set it to *https://duckduckgo.com/?q=* and it seems to work).
  
  
It's been a week of Duck Duck Going, and I like it so far. It's
refreshing to use a new search engine. I have not suffered from bad
results so far -- nothing compared to what made me move from Altavista
to Google a very long time ago :D   
  
And oh... nooo.. what now.. [Browser Fingerprint][] ??!
