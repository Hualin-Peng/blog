A Pythoneers directory

I've been helping in the organization of Pycon France for years,
--not recently though-- and I've also been lightly involved in the
FOSDEM Python room this year.

There's one thing that frustrated me a lot in this exercise:
the inability to reach out specific people in the Python community.

I was never really able to answer questions like this:

- I want a list of all Numpy specialists in Europe that are willing to
  give a talk.

- I want a list of all women developers that are willing to give
  a talk about Python in Europe.

- I want a list of experts that can help me selecting the
  right talks for a given topic.

- I want to know who loves Python in Burgundy!

Of course you can shout out on a blog, on twitter, or try to reach
the right people through your network.

For the second question --reaching out women-- I've learnt too
late that I should've worked with the PyLadies on this, or
even the Ada initiative, and certainly not the PSF.

But this is too much work. I just want to reach out the right
**people** without having to go through a lot of intermediates.

I want to have a single place on the internets where Bob and
Sarah can add a list of topics they are involved into, tell if
they are interested in giving talks, in what area of the world,
etc.

I think it can't be Lanyard because they would probably not
let me query their users database with specific queries
like the ones I mentioned. It can't be Linkedin for the same
reasons.

I was pointed to some directories that looked a bit like
what I envisioned, but they were local directories that just
listed Python people without giving all the info I
am looking for.

So what I think the Python community is missing is a
**worldwide Pythoneers directory** that is not affiliated to any
group, organization, company or foundation -- were users can
fill out a profile with their interests in Python.

So I am going to try to build that tool during the
next Europython in Italy.

The features I want are pretty simple:

- the ability to connect with your github or bitbucket
  account.

- the ability to build a page about you, a little bit
  like about.me, but with predefined, *optional* fields
  like your gender, your location, the projects you are
  involved into, and so on.

- the ability for someone to query & reach out
  a specific group of people.

Of course, this raises some issues, like the fact that
it could be used by commercial companies to do send some
unsollicited e-mails like recruiting e-mails, or
simple spams. But people are already used to deal with
this as soon as they have a public life.

If you are interested in this, reach me out or add a
comment. The goal will be to talk about the idea, refine it,
and have a first version running by the end of Europython,
and see if we get somewhere.
