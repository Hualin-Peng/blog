I don't have time to talk in detail about it at this time, but I wanted
to say that the [Bobun Paris Sprint][] was a great event.   
  
Together with the [sprint][] we have done a few month before here at
AlterWay, this a great momentum for the French Plone community.   
  
Those events will probably be recurrent from now on (the one we
organized at AlterWay will be organize every year for sure, and I think
the Bobun team wants to do it again as well).   
  
Maybe we will be able at some point in a few years to organize the
PloneConf in Paris ?   
  
That would be a blast :D
