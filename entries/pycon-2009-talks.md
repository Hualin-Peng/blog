Title: Pycon 2009 talks

I have 2 accepted talks at Pycon, that is great. I would like to say
that the Pycon review system is awesome because you can see what the
reviewers have said, and understand why your talk was accepted or
declined.   
  
I was a bit frustrated that my Atomisator talk was declined, but I
think it makes sense : this is a new tool, and beside my user group and
a few people, it is not really used yet.   
  
One reviewer said that it had to be picked, and another one answered :
  
> I agree that PyCon should not restrict itself to well-known projects,
> but it should definitely restrict itself to projects that are (a) in
> production use, (b) under active development, and (c) likely to still
> be so in a year. There are so many projects meeting these criteria
> that for me, the bar is very high indeed to spend a talk slot on one
> that does not.

  
Ok, fair enough : I will present this talk at Pycon 2010 and they won't
have any argument to decline it ;)   
  
The talks that made it:   
-   How AlterWay releases web applications using zc.buildout
-   On the importance of PyPI in delivering and building Python
    softwares - mirroring, fail-over and third-party package indexes

  
I will get into greater details later on.
