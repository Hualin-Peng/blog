I was nominated then accepted as a member of the Python Software
Foundation. Thanks Marc-Andr√© and others.   
  
Anyone can contribute to the Python community without being a PSF
member of course, so what's the point ?   
  
It's quite simple: being a member means that you can vote and
participate in the decisions made by the PSF for Python. This means a
lot to me since I am devoting a lot of my free time to contribute to
Python.   
  
And... well... I am just proud ! :)
