We are working here at the Paris Sprint, and many things are going on. I
wanted to do a quick wrapup before a longer and final wrapup.   
  
Here's all the tasks going on (I might miss some):   
-   **Youenn** and **Cartsen** are working on
    [**plone.recipe.apache**][], that will let you build and/or setup
    Apache in a buildout
-   **Michel** presented a very interested talk yesterday on how
    **insecure** Plone can be (Man in the Middle attacks, etc), on the
    various existing solutions, and works on things to enhance it
-   **Maik** leads a [**Funittest**][] group, teaching the tool to
    people, and enhancing i
-   **Olivier** and **Christophe** are working on [**Grok**][] to learn
    it. Christophe worked yesterday on filling content to the new
    zope.org web site
-   **Matthew**, **Alex** and **I** are working on
    [**PloneSoftwareCenter**][] and **plone.org**, so the website can be
    ready to move to an egg-enabled Plone 3. wOOt !
-   **Gael**, **Jean-Francois** (and **Kai** yesterday) are working on
    "[**Pimp my Buildbot**][]": configure and launch a complete buildbot
    system in a matter of minutes, using a simple buildout cfg file and
    running a simple command. I think this could be used for Plone
    repository and the collective as well ! The tool will be move to the
    collective at the end of the sprint.
-   **Gilles**, **Cyrille**, and others (sorry, can't keep up with all
    names), are working on [**iw.fss**][] (FileSystemStorage for plone
    3)
-   **Mustapha** and **Anton** are making sweet things in
    [**ZopeSkel**][]
-   **Anton** worked also on finding the best way to do aysnhronous
    tasks in Plone**   
    **
-   There's a big [**PloneGov**][] team that is working on making the
    tool friendly with various government systems.
-   **Jean-Nicolas** leads the work on **kss/eventPush**, so we all get
    a upload widget with live feedback (no flash inside ;))
-   **Godefroid** and **Lennart** are **Grok**-ing as well;
-   **Christophe** is preparing [**collective.kss.fly\_guy**][], a tool
    that provides drag and drop in folder\_contents
-   **Harito**, **Christian** and **Wim** are making a sweet new theme
    for Plone: "**Notre Dame**". The theme is kept quite generic, with
    all the plone tools/portlets designed in blue tones, kept in mind to
    be easy adjustable and changed to other color schemes. It will be a
    table-less egg for Plone 3.

  
More blogging tomorrow, I need to get back to my task :)
