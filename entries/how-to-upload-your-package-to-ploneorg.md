We have been working hard in the past few months with my Plone friends
to make it happen.   
  
It's now available : [Plone.org][] is acting like PyPI in its
[Products][] section, which means that you can use [Distutils][] to
register and upload your packages in both places now.   
  
I have written a small tutorial on plone.org to explain how to use it:
[http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/how-to-upload-your-package-to-plone.org][]
  
  
I will also explain during my Pycon presentation
([http://us.pycon.org/2009/conference/schedule/event/44][]) how this new
feature at Plone.org will help people that are working with Plone and
Python packages.
