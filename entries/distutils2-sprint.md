Thanks to Logilab, our host for this, we will have a Distutils2 sprint
in Paris from the 27th to the 30st January. I won't be sprinting the
27th but I will be, starting the 28th until the end.   
  
The sprint will focus on:   
-   the install/remove scripts
-   polishing Distutils2 for the next alpha release
-   many other things...

  
I'll do a rehearsal of my Pycon 2011 talk, as an introduction to
packaging and Distutils2. The sprint is open to anyone, but their will
be no introduction to Python, TDD or sprinting and we expect
participants to know those.   
  
If you are interested, add your name here:

with us online if you can't make it to Paris. If you want to do so, add
you name with that precision (online).
