If you want to work (or try to find some bugs in it to help out) with
the latest bleeding-edge Distutils trunk version that will be shipped
with Python 2.7 and Python 3.2, you can do it now !   
  
I am creating a nighlty build every day here now :

This distribution can be installed in your existing Python 2.6
installation, and will probably work with 2.5.   
  
I'm not planning to publish standalone versions yet, except nighlty
build, at least until 2.7 and 3.2 are starting to be released as alphas.
