Wow.   
  
I have been really involved in Plone for about one year now. This
community just rocks. I met incredible guys, and did tons of work and
experiments with them.   
  
I have [asked][] the community for help to go to the Plone Conf with a
fund raising. I raised the funds in 3 days... I am astonished, this is a
marvelous gift from you guys. I alsmot cried when I saw all those people
donating.   
  
I am so lucky, and so proud to be part of the Plone community and to
know all of you. I will work hard to produce the best tutorial I can for
the Plone Conf, and continue of course my work in the community tasks I
am currently involved in.   
  
I would like to say a big, warm thank to (the order is chronological,
from the latest donation to the first one):
