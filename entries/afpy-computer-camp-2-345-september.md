Last year at the end of the summer, we had in my country house (I am
renovating) near Dijon/France, a nice week-end consisting of tasting
Burgundy wines and coding, demoing etc.

We had a great time, and I'd like to organize this event again this
year. I am blogging very early about it to make sure that interested
people will save the date !
