Title: MoPy = Mozilla + Python

Python is gaining a lot of traction in many Mozilla projects. From the
[SUMO][] and [AMO][] websites, to [Socorro][] and the next-gen [Firefox
Sync][] server. I can fairly say that it becomes a mainstream language
for building server-side software in our eco-system. This is making me
really happy, since I am involved in the Python project.

I won't blog here about the pro's and con's of Python versus PHP or
Java etc., there are already a lot of good articles out there about it.
I'd be biased anyways ;). The least I can say is that it makes a lot of
sense for us at all levels, to use Python and its great libs and
frameworks. To name a few:   
-   Django, used by AMO and SUMO
-   WebOb and Paste, used by Sync (next-gen) to build wsgi-based Web
    Services
-   SQLAlchemy, used by Sync (next-gen) to work with our databases.

  
When I joined Mozilla, one thing that I really wanted to do was to
start a "Python in Mozilla" informal user group. A space where people
working on the various Mozilla projects could share about Python.   
  
I started a mailing list here : [MoPy Mailing List][].   
  
We also had a small meeting at Mountain View HQ. The WebDev team was in
town so it was a good opportunity to do it. We talked about our various
approaches to handle configuration files in our projects and that was
quite interesting to share. We had people from WebDev, Labs and
Services.   
  
I'd love to share ideas about Python with the whole Mozilla community,
and maybe try to organise more meetings in the future.   
  
If you are involved in a Mozilla project, and use Python -- or simply
curious about Python -- please join the mailing list and don't be shy to
post.   
  
Semi-related: I have submitted a talk for the next Pycon in Atlanta
about Firefox Sync, and will try to organize a Mozilla BoF there as
well.
