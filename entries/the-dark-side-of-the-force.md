Remember [the funny post about Python vs Perl on Python mailing list][]
?   
  
I think it fits pretty well to TDD. Here's a slighty modified version:
  
  
EXTERIOR: DAGOBAH -- DAY   
  
With Yoda strapped to his back, Luke climbs up one of the   
many thick vines that grow in the swamp until he reaches the   
Dagobah statistics lab. Panting heavily, he continues his   
exercises -- writing test-driven code in Python, making   
fakes, mock objects.   
  
YODA: Code! Test! Yes. A programmer's strength flows from
non-regression.   
Never stop doing tests. The dark side of code maintainability   
reach you would without tests. Easy to write without them when   
package you create. If once you start down the dark path,   
forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will.   
  
LUKE: Isn't it simpler not to do tests ?   
  
YODA: No... no... no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.   
  
LUKE: So why I should do tests then ?   
  
YODA: You will know. When your code you try to correct six months from
  
now.
