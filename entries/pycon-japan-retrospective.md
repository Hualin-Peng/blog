Title: Pycon Japan Retrospective

I was back last week from my trip in Japan for [Pycon Japan][], and I
wish I had spent an extra week there to see more places there.   
### Pycon Japan

  
Pycon Japan was a blast, really well-organized and from what I've heard
they had more than 200 attendees, which is a good size for a single day
conference. I took some notes for Pycon France.

I gave a keynote session -- you can grab the slides here:
[http://ziade.org/pyconjp-keynote.html][]. The keynote was mostly about
Packaging and a little bit on my (subjective ;)) opinions about the
uptake of Python 3, PyPy etc.   
  
I've spent the day chatting with people, and even with Guido himself,
since the organizers set up a Skype-like video chat system were we could
do live 1:1 chats with him. Guido spent quite some time with every
attendee that wanted to speak with him. Thumbs up to Guido and to the
organizers for this nice idea.   
  
Most talks were in Japanese but lots of speakers used dual
English/Japanese slides so I could follow a bit. The lightning talk
session at the end was fun -- as usual for those, and the organizers
ended up offering some Mozilla Goodies after a giant rock/scissor/paper
game. Then we had a party in a pub and ended up in another bar late at
night.   
  
On a side note, I was amazed by the number of attendees asking me for
an autograph on my book, [Expert Python Programming][], translated in
Japanese.   
  
Also, check out [Ian Lewis' blog about the event][].   
### Blockdiag

  
Komiya Takeshi showed me his tool called **blockdiag**, which is a DSL
you can use to add diagrams in your documentation. The nice thing is
that it provides a Sphinx extension so you can add diagrams in your
documentation through simple expressions, and have Sphinx generate for
you the diagrams on the fly. There's even an interactive online shell:

I've challenged Komiya to write a few diagrams I have for some Mozilla
projects using his tool, and it took a few seconds for him to build
them. So, I am going to use this in the future.   
### Tokyo, Kyoto, Nara

  
After the conference, we left with my wife to visit the city, then
other places in Japan: Kyoto and Nara. Nara and its big park filled with
temples is a very beautiful place. It was not the best time in the year
to visit because it was very hot, but it still was really worth it. The
best time is probably in March, when the cherry blossoms are opening.   
  
We went to some beautiful parks and temples, and slept in traditional
Ryokans. [More pics here][]

Japan has met my expectations : the food is great, people are extremely
nice, and there are beautiful places to see.   
  
A huge Thanks to the Pycon Japan Team for inviting me and taking care
of Amina and I (Naokata Jay Hotta, Yasushi Masuda, Ian Lewis, Manabu
Terada, Morimoto Tetsuya, etc..)
