[Alexis][] started to work with me this week from my house and we're
having good times. More geeks from Afpy are joining us this week-end for
wine-drinking and working on a Python technical writing project.   
  
While working myself on [AppSync][] with the fine folks from Mozilla
Labs, I am mentoring Alexis to get him up to speed on our projects &
standards at Mozilla Services.[![image][]][]   
  
[Cornice][], is a perfect match for him to start working -- it's
isolated enough so he can have fun and produce features that are
immediately useful, yet learn our standards & processes.   
  
So we worked on its design with the help of its principal user, Ben
Bangert, and I asked Alexis to blog about the work & doc we produced
since Monday.
