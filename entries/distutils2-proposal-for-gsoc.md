Title: Distutils2 proposal for GSOC
Date: 2010-03-18 15:24
Category: python

**EDIT 2010-03-28 : Started a detailed list here
[http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/Distutils2][]**   
The Google Summer of Code will be happening again this year, and I am
going to propose a project under the PSF : Distutils2.   
  
If you are a student and you are interested in building with me the
replacer of Distutils, this is an opportunity to contribute to an Open
Source project !   
  
A finite and detailed list of tasks will be defined just before the
proposals deadline, to avoid proposing a project that is too vague or to
make it impossible to rate the student at mid-term. This list will be
built at the last moment, because I am unable right now to know exactly
what will be the state of Distutils2 this summer.   
  
But here's a taste of what the student will work on:   
-   work on the implementation of PEP 376
-   finish the implementation of the static metadata (that is the "no
    more setup.py" subproject ;) )
-   work on a "configure" command that will generate a configuration
    file other commands can read back and use.
-   write a tutorial on how to use Distutils2
-   promote and evangelize Distutils2 - This will consist of helping
    python project to switch/adopt Distutils2. We will define a list of
    targets and the student will be in charge of helping them switching
    to Distutils2 if they want.

  
If you are interested, be sure to join the[mailing list][] and stay
tuned !
