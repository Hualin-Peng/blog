Title: Python Packaging Documentation sprint April 2-3

This is a short notice but here we go: We're having an online
documentation sprint this week-end.   
  
The goal is to clean up the documentation for packaging before I do the
merge in the stdlib.   
  
If you want to help please read this page :
[http://wiki.python.org/moin/Packaging/Sprints/DocumentationSprint][]
and join the IRC tomorrow and/or the day after.   
  
Anyone can help here, since the documentation aims to three targeted
readers:   
-   Developers that want to package/release their projects
-   OS Packagers
-   End-users

  
I'll be sprinting myself Sunday since I am travelling today and
tomorrow. Kudos to Kelsey, who's leading the sprint effort.
