Last, a second important project will be done this summer, to create a
PyPI Testing infrastucture. Congrats to Mouad Benchchaoui and Thanks to
Jesse Noller !   
  
I'll be mentoring Alexis, and I'll help other mentors and make sure we
all synchronize our efforts. I'm pretty excited about this upcoming GSOC
because it's a true opportunity to speed up the work we need to do, in
order to built the new packaging tools we all want to have.
