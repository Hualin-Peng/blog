June is a very intense month for me, and the rest of the year should be
way more intense.   
  
For once, this entry is not about packaging, and a bit personal. But I
want to share this with the Python community because that's my second
family.   
  
First of all, Suki was born two days ago on June 17th ! That's my
lovely little girl, my second child. I am so happy about this (you bet).
Her aunt, [who is creating short movies for a living][], has made a
small video to welcome Suki to the world. [Check it out, she's done an
amazing job][].   
  
I was looking for a job and I have found one. I have accepted a
position at [Mozilla Labs][]and I'll start next Monday. I am very
excited about this for many reasons. The projects I'll be working on are
great, and the Mozilla people & values match perfectly with how I feel
about open source and the web. I'll start talking about this here in a
few weeks I guess, once things will be really started. Thanks to all the
people that helped me in my job seeking during these last months !   
  
Last, my latest book "Expert Python Programming" was[translated in
Japanese][]. I know some authors are translated in other languages quite
often, but for me it was a big deal, because I have worked around with
the translation team and the Japanese book is actually better than the
original book, thanks to them, their feedback, passion about Python,
ideas and work. Now I need to go to Japan to meet them :D
