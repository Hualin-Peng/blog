We made the shirts at home for PyCon FR and that was a LOT of fun, even
if we had to work hard to make sure all shirt were ready by the time the
event started. We used a silk-screen technique and the output looks
really professional. The ink used makes the shirt design last longer
than shirts that uses transfer. Although the number of colors is
limited.

Guess what: some people ordered us some t-shirts for some other events,
so some more fun ahead ! :D
