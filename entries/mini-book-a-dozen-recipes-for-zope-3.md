I have started a few months ago to write [a cookbook for Zope 3][], both
in english and french. The challenge was to be able to:   
-   follow the project code base wich is evolving (too) fast
-   provide transversal knowledge for developers that wants to create
    real world things with zope

  
The project was growing and doing well, but I had to stop, because of
Nuxeo's drop of Zope: it became too hard to follow Zope 3 development
exclusively in my spare time.   
  
Nevertheless, [Baiju copied the recipes in his wiki][], and hopefully
they will be reinjected in the work done their to construct a mainstream
book.   
  
However, this experience was really exciting, because I had to set up a
writing process, [explained last summer at Europython][], based on agile
documentation principles, to be able to provide up-to-date materials,
and examples codes.   
  
As a souvenir ;), I have generated raw pdfs in both english and french.
They might be useful to people that are discovering Zope 3 out there, as
they also introduces developing methodologies.   
  
Here they are:   
-   [Zope 3 cookbook in english][]
-   [Zope 3 cookbook in french][]

  
Let me know of they are useful to you !   
  
Important note: those recipes are not following a book plan, so the pdf
table of content can look a bit strange to readers.
