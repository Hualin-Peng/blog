My tutorial proposal on [how to document a Python project][], has been
accepted. I have quite a good idea on the things I need to present for
people to understand how to integrate documentation writing in their
development cycle.[See the class outline for a summary][]   
  
The main idea behind this tutorial is to explain how documenting can be
done through coding and testing, in order to create lightweight but
sufficient documentation instead of creating documents at the end of the
project.   
  
The technique is based on:   
-   [literate programming][], introduced by the father of Tex, [Donald
    Knuth][]
-   Agile documentation principles, which uses agile techniques for
    document writing . These have been [summarized in a book by Andreas
    Rüping][].

  
and provide simple processes to avoid the *"programmers hate writing
document"* effect.   
  
For open source projects, the final step of agile documentation is:   
-   to **automate the update of the dedicated website** everytime
    developers change the base code.
-   to provide a **visible document landscape** to anyone interested to
    the project
-   to **increase the quality of the code** base
-   to make **developers become good writers**, and make them love it

  
  
  
  
This tutorial is based on my work on [zope-cookbook.org][], which tried
to follow a fast-moving technology : Zope, and some work on several
Python open source projects, books and articles I have written.   
  
Nevertheless, the conference is next February, and I would like to
integrate more feedback on how people feel about documenting their
application.   
  
If you are a developer, using Python or any language out there, or a
project leader, I would love to get a few words about your experience on
the topic, in order to enhance this tutorial.   
-   What is the place of documentation in your project cycles ?
-   What are the different document types you use ?
-   What kind of formats do you use for you document ? (Word,
    OpenOffice, Latex, reST..)
-   Do you have dedicated people that write documentation ?
-   How do your developers feel about documentation ?
-   ...
