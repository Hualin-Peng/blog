I did my presentation yesterday, and it seems like people enjoyed it,
from what I've heard in the halls and seen online. I am very glad about
this feedback because packaging is not the sexiest topic in programming
conferences in general.   
  
Anyways, here are my slides :

**EDIT: And here's the video on blip : [http://bit.ly/dlPB2X][]**   
  
And as promised, I've answered to all the questions people asked in the
google moderator :[http://www.google.com/moderator/\#16/e=4395
.][]Thanks to everyone that has participated.   
  
I am now going to enjoy the rest of the Pycon event and I am looking
forward to the sprints.
