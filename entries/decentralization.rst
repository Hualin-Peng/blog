This is long time due !

Following up with my `previous blog post <http://blog.ziade.org/2014/05/23/data-decentralization-amp-mozilla>`_
I have started a Decentralization Mailing list.

The goal of this mailing list is to discuss technologies related to data decentralization
in Mozilla projects - and in particular in the ones we work at in the Cloud Services team
(but it can go beyond of course)

A few topic examples that people brought up:

#. Could remoteStorage be used with Firefox Account to build Firefox OS apps where people can store their own data ?
#. Can Firefox Sync use a remoteStorage backend ?
#. Why can't I run a simple "apt-get install firefox-sync" and host my own server ?
#. What about peer-to-peer ? How does that fit with the services we provide ?


The list is at : https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-decentralization

I will wait a week or so to launch topics there, but if you are interested
in this topic, if you want to lurk or to launch an idea - please join.

On my side, the first topic I will probably talk about in this ML
is #1.
