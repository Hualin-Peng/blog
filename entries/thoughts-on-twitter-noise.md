Title: Thoughts on Twitter noise

I was following a little more than 100 people on Twitter, and I realized
I was mainly following my own technical tribe. By **tribe** I mean
people gravitating around Python core, and since a few months a few
Mozillians.   
  
Well, what happens is that most tweets that are sent by people I follow
are just circling around, and I get a lot of noise. And I am evolving in
some kind of *closed circle* of information.   
  
For Example, if the PSF account sends a tweet. It's retweeted by Jesse,
Voidspace etc.. The most interesting Mozilla news will be retweeted by
people like Chris Beard, or Alex Limi.   
  
So why do I have (and we all have it seems) so many followers that are
like me ? I think that's related to the fact that people follow friends
or acquaintances they meet in conferences etc. We use Twitter a little
bit like Facebook in this respect.   
  
But I don't want to do this anymore, I think Twitter has much more
value than just listing people you know or you like. I want to cut the
noise there and try to get more value out of it.   
### Reducing my own noise

  
It turns out I am what Klout calls a *Specialist* ([see here)][]. But I
am redundant. I mean, look at this:   
1.  Terry sends [a mail at Python-dev][] about the fact that Python
    3.2.0 was released twenty years after 0.9
2.  [I tweet it][]
3.  Michael [tweets it][] right after
4.  Many other tweet it in turn.

  
So what it really means is : does it make sense to duplicate on Twitter
news related to Python when they are already published in other medium ?
I guess it made sense for this one, since it brings to a larger circle
of Python fans this news. Guido himself tweeted it.   
  
And I like to tweet those things -- And I have more than 1k followers
that seem to be mainly interested in Python, so they want those tweets
and consider that I am a specialized reporter.   
  
One way to cut the noise on my side would be to check if someone has
already talked about it, and eventually retweet it, like when you try
send a link in Reddit and it tells you someone has already done it.   
  
Or maybe just become more specialized -- stop talking about wine or
random Python news I know they will be tweeted eventually. And also,
maybe limit myself to 5 tweets a day.   
### Reducing other people noise

  
In order to cut the noise, I need to keep only a few "Specialists", for
every domain I am interested in. I could probably just follow
[voidspace][] to get the latest news from the Python world.   
  
The real value though, would be to follow *other* people that talk
about other topics than Python or Mozilla. That does not necessarily
means I'll follow random people, but rather people that are partially
sharing my interests and opening a window to other worlds at the same
time. People that are in my tribes, but also part of other tribes.
That's a little bit what Malcom Gladwell calls [connectors][] I guess.   
  
For example, [ogrisel][] is part of my Python user group but really
focuses on AI. I enjoy his updates because they are food for thoughts. I
also enjoy [zooko][] updates because he has one foot in Python and one
foot in security.   
  
So, I guess the most logical thing for me to do with Twitter would be
to:   
-   stop following Python or Mozilla people, except a very few
    "Specialists"
-   follow more "Connectors" like ogrisel

  
I am already down to 40 people I follow and will probably cut it down
in half.   
  
I already feel better today, my Tweetdeck backlog was greatly reduced.
I wanted to tweet something about the weather but I held it this time ;)
