**edit**: I have changed the blog title, which was not correct in
English, thanks Maik ;)   
  
I wanted to react on [Martinj's blog][] to make things clear about
[Pycon FR][]   
### Background

  
First of all here's a little background about Pycon FR.   
  
[Afpy][] (Association Francophone Python) is a french Python user group
created four years ago. The group counts around 100 members and is the
only one of this size in french-speaking countries as far as we know. It
has members from France, Belgium, Canada and North Africa countries.   
  
Many meetings are organized throughout the year, mainly in Paris, and
sometimes in Charleroi in Belgium.   
  
An important event took place at the "Cité des sciences" in Paris last
summer, called "Journées Python" We had around 80 attendees and a rich
program was given during two days. Topics where presented by french
speaking people from France and Belgium, and we had talks about AI,
Django, Zope, TuxDroid, etc   
  
Some videos are available on the web, you can probably reach them from
here: [http://video.google.fr/videosearch?q=journees.afpy.org][]   
  
The conference was 100% free for attendees. We also decided to chose
carefully the dates so the conference would not compete with other
events like Europython.   
  
This event was a \*true\* success.   
  
This event is now called Pycon FR, to be in the same line of what
happens in some other countries. This makes a lot of sense indeed, to
have national Python events, with standardized names.   
### Attendees

  
Pycon FR attendees are mainly people that speaks english but for some
of them not enough to easily follow English talks. Most of those people
would not make it to Europython because of this language barrier, and a
national conference held in Paris is something that was quite missing at
this time, for them.   
  
So PyCon FR is just a sign of the growing interest about Python, and
should be seen as a 100% positive and constructive thing, believe me.   
  
Together with Europython and Pycon US, the "local" PyCons are in my
opinion, a very good thing to spread the good word. We will, like last
year, promote Europython there. Maybe we could even do a survey this
year to know exactly who goes to Europython, etc.   
### Pycon FR expansion plans

  
When I said in my last blog entry that we were working on making it
less french-centric, and having international attendees, I should have
explained it better to make sure no one thinks Pycon FR might be a bad
thing for Europython.   
-   If we do invite international speakers, it will be done only if we
    are able to provide a live translation system.
-   The event date will always be picked carefully, as usual, so it does
    not compete with Europython.

  
### Europython and local PyCons expansion

  
Here's my opinion about what Europython strategy could be: since it is
an international english-speaking event that gathers a lot of people. It
could be the seed to set up a local Pycon event in places where it does
not exist yet, using the momentum of the event.   
  
This could be done by working with the local user group this way, by
organizing maybe two years in a row Europython there. So, maybe we could
see "Pycon Lithunia" next year ? Then move EuroPython to Amsterdam and
see "Pycon The Netherlands" in two years ?   
  
Europython exists to promote the language at an international level, so
that could be a good way to spread imho.   
  
But please, pretty please, don't see local Pycons as Europython
competitors, this is not true, this happens just because Python is
growing.   
  
Everyone should be happy about that I think. I disagree with the fact
that each conference might fight to have the "best international
speakers" for a very simple reason: the number of speakers is growing
too, and I don't think either Pycon either EuroPython will ever miss of
interesting talks.   
  
The next smart move I think is to organize and synchronize all these
events, and that is where the Python Software Foundation has a role to
play in my opinion. They have started anyway, and I am really confident
about what will happen next.
