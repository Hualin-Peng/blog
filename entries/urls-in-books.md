Title: URLs in books

I received some complaints about the fact that some links in my books
were dead by the time they were printed.   
  
For the next book I am working on, I have proposed to my editor to set
up a website to keep track of all references mentioned.   
  
By using unique short ascii references throughout the book, it's easy
to provide a simple redirect service to the target URL, and to fix it
when it changes (just by setting up a mail alert if your redirect
reaches a 404).   
  
For example, if I am referring to **mod\_wsgi** in my book, I can write
this reference: ***\#mod\_wsgi***, and provide a redirection to
***http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi*** into my website, through a
unique, mnemotechnic permanent URL :
***http://ziade.org/urls/mod\_wsgi***.   
  
This small service, Ã  la Tiny URL is not a burden for the reader imho :
he is using his computer anyway when he visits an URL mentioned in a
book.   
  
It's a simple idea I am sure a lot of people have thaught about before,
but I fail to see it applied in the books I am buying these days. Is
there any good reason I fail to see ?
