Wow. I've realized this today. We've founded that user group in 2003,
when I've proposed a Pythoneers meeting in Paris through my Python/Plone
forum.   
  
We've created [Afpy.org][] after that, the non-profit organization, and
we had many meetings since then, including various Pycon France.   
  
Many people I've met through the Afpy are now people that I consider
friends for life, even if I don't see them much these days.   
  
And Python still rocks 8 years after we've started all of this, getting
bigger and bigger every year, thanks to the awesome leadership of Guido
and all Python core dev.   
  
The bottom line is: if you like Python and don't have a user group in
your area, create one.
