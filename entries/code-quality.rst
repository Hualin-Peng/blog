Flake8 plugins
--------------

Some time ago, we've unified our efforts to build & maintain code quality
checkers. For instance, Flake8 is now entirely based on plugins: there's a
pep8, pyflakes & mccabe plugin and you can add more.

The family of Flake8 plugin is growing & Florent has started listing them
at http://flake8.readthedocs.org/en/latest/extensions.html#existing-extensions

Mailing list
------------

Another good news is the creation of a mailing list dedicated to all
the code quality tools : http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/code-quality

If you're interested in those tools, or you are maintaing one yourself,
consider joining this mailing list.
