Mozilla is now officially listed as a [Pycon US sponsor][].   
  
This is great news for Python and for the Mozilla Community: more and
more projects in Mozilla are using Python. It's the mainstream language
for all the work we're doing in the [Services team][] on server-side,
and numerous projects like [SUMO][] or [AMO][] are powered by Python.   
  
So, if you are involved in the Mozilla community and in Python, you
should consider [submitting a talk or a tutorial][]. Or just attend to
the conference in [Santa Clara next March][].   
  
Pycons are always [a lot of fun][].
