Title: 4 simple tips for wannabe remote workers

I've been working remotely for the past 6 years now. I can't believe it
has been so long already.   
  
*Quick explanation. I've started to work remotely for good reasons : I
have a 7 years old kid that lives with his mother in Dijon, France.
Since I am not with her anymore, I need to stick around Dijon in order
to see my boy as often as possible. Until he's old enough to visit me
elsewhere by himself ;)   
*   
  
6 years earlier, working remotely was not really possible in France.
Companies were reluctant to do it because they thought they were unable
to control their employees if they were not physically present.   
  
But in the software industry, a well-organized company has no reasons
to be reluctant to remote workers. As long as the proper tools and the
proper processes are set, a remote developer (and under some
circumstances a manager) is more efficient if he works from home. And it
makes the company save some money in most cases (less office space to
rent, etc.)   
  
Some XP/Lean methodologies are organized around the fact that the whole
team is physically present but it's quite simple to adapt the rules to
integrate remote people. Skype and other tools are working fine these
days.   
  
Of course, I don't think a 100% remote work is doable: you have to meet
people physically on a regular basis. That's important because a meeting
in person is better in specific phases in software projects. (launch and
design phases)   
  
Anyways, here's a condensed list of tips if you have never worked
remotely and might do it.   
  
I hope you will find them useful. And if you are a remote worker and
have other tips, please comment this blog post.   
### Tip \#1 - Everything you do, should be done in a VCS and an issue
tracker

  
For all aspects of a software project, it's important to use a Version
Control System (I use Mercurial) even for your design notes or
documentation. Trust me, that's the only efficient way for other people
that need to work on the same parts you are working on to stay informed.
Listing the history of a file in a (D)VCS gives the reader a good
understanding of what's going on.   
  
The only problem with this approach is that everyone in the team needs
to know how to use a VCS. Marketers and other people that are not used
to developers tools might be reluctant with this, but there are GUI
tools now on the top of every good VCS system (like Tortoise).   
  
Like the VCS, using a good issue tracker to track every task that is
done is very important. And issues should be linked to VCS changesets
and vice-versa.   
  
I use for instance Bitbucket with Mercurial, and they have a nice
plugin that will add a comment to an issue with a link to a changeset,
if you use the proper tag in the changeset comment when you push your
change. All issues trackers do this these days: Trac, Jira, etc.   
### Tip \#2 - A daily over-the-phone quick meeting is a good idea

  
The best way to follow what other people are doing in the project is to
have quick meetings every day. I don't think it's a good idea to have
the meeting in the morning, because people don't start their work at the
same time and it's better to discuss what's hot (==what you have done
during the day.). So I like evening meetings better.   
  
A short meeting on Skype or over the phone, that doesn't last more than
ten minutes, is perfect. It will "force" you to briefly summarize what
you have done during the day before the meeting starts. Doing these
brief summaries is a great exercise for yourself too: it helps you
understand where you spend your time.   
  
And don't do these meetings over IRC or chat: a voice meeting is
faster, and is a good opportunity to "humanize" your work day a little
bit. Spending a whole day at home working alone can be depressing
sometimes, so hearing your colleague voices feels good.   
### Tip \#3 - Your new office open-space is an IRC room

  
The best way to communicate instantly with your colleagues is a room in
the Internet Relay Chat or any other IM system that allows several
people to talk. I've also discovered lately [Etherpad][], which is the
perfect IRC companion : a real-time collaborative text editor.   
### Tip \#4 - Separate your private life from your work

  
Some people think that working at home means you work less, but that's
a myth. Most of the time, you work more because it's so easy to finish
something you have started, when you are at home. It's not fun to work
alone in the evening in a big open space once other people have left .   
  
But working late at home is a very dangerous habit for your private
life. Your wife and kids will start to hate your work. So be sure to
have office hours and to separate physically your office from the rest
of the house.
