Title: PyPI usage statistics, the zc.buildout effect
Date: 2008-05-08 20:59
Category: plone, python, zope

It is interesting to look at the usage statistics at PyPI:
[http://pypi.python.org/webstats/usage\_200805.html\#DAYSTATS][]   
  
Besides the front page, the most visited pages are in order (same thing
in April):   
-   zc.buildout
-   setuptools
-   zc.recipe.egg
-   plone.recipe.zope2instance
-   plone.recipe.distros
-   python-openid
-   elementtree
-   plone.recipe.zope2install

  
Then the packages in the top 60 are mainly zope eggs. This corresponds
to the sequence done by a Plone or Zope being build in a buildout.   
  
If you take a closer look at
[http://pypi.python.org/webstats/url\_200804.html][], the next top hits
corresponds to zope.\* then plone.\* packages.
