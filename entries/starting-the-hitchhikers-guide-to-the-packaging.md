**DON'T PANIC !**   
  
Following-up various discussions we had about the need to provide a
guide for people that want to understand our rather complex packaging
eco-system, and how they can use it,   
  
I've decided to start *The Hitchhiker's Guide to Packaging*. The goals
are:   
-   consolidate in one single Sphinx-based powered website, tutorials
    and documentation on how to use the various packaging tools and how
    to package, release and distribute your Python application.
-   provide guidelines to the community that are up-to-date with the
    latest work done in packaging
-   see if it can be added in the Python documentation itself at some
    point when its mature, as Georg Brandl suggested.

  
If you want to join this documentation effort, by adding your existing
documentation to this guide, by writing new one, or by helping on copy
editing or reviewing, let me know (\#distutils on Freenode, or by mail)
  
  
The project repository is hosted on bitbucket:

I've also created a google group:
