Title: new blog location, new design, update your bookmarks

I was thinking about doing this change for a while, and I took the time
to do it last week-end:   
  
My personal website at [http://ziade.org][] is now powered by
[Pylons][] and [Atomisator][]. It's both in French and English (the urls
are translated too).   
  
It contains:   
-   a home page with my latest twitter entries
-   a blog (this one)
-   some other pages like a résumé, a list of the books I wrote, a
    projects page, etc.

  
I am still using Wordpress to write my blog entries but they are now
processed with Atomisator and displayed at [http://ziade.org/blog][].
The feed is now located at [http://ziade.org/blog/xml][] and I will make
sure all Planets use this URL for now on.   
  
Next I'll probably :   
-   move to another blogging tool, and my readers will not suffer from
    the change as long as they use the ziade.org feed url.
-   add some portlets into the new site, like the ones I have on
    Wordpress.

  
How do you like this new look ? Any comment / advice ? :)
