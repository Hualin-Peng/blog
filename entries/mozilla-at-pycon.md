Mozilla folks will be giving a few talks at Pycon US 2011, the biggest
Python conference. That's happening in one month in Atlanta.   
-   Kumar McMillan on [Supporting all version of Python All the Time
    with Tox][]
-   Ian Bicking on [Javascript for People who know Python][].
-   Me on [Firefox Sync][] and [Packaging, from Distutils1 to
    Distutils2][]
-   Any talk that I've missed (please let me know)

  
Brian [asked me a few questions about my talks][] on the Pycon Blog if
you want to have more details on them.   
  
If you like Python or Mozilla, you should definitely consider going to
Pycon.   
  
And hey, Mozilla is a proud Lanyard sponsor of Pycon this year !
