The Mozilla Cloud Services team just got a little bit reorganized
and I am now managing a new subteam.

I am very happy about the new subteam I am part of: Alexis, Rémy and myself
are the **French Cloud Services** team. We're still working on projects with
other teams of course - but being a team in the same timezone and speaking
the same native language helps a lot.

One topic that is *owned* by our team is building and maintaining tools
that help build, deploy & run web services.

Currently, the three most active projects are:

- `Loads <https://loads.readthedocs.org>`_ -- a distributed load testing tool we use to verify that a given
  service scales.
- `Circus <https://circus.readthedocs.org>`_ -- an extensible process supervisor we're using in all our deployments
- `Cornice <https://cornice.readthedocs.org>`_ -- a Python framework on the top of Pyramid that helps you write
  web services - as opposed to "web pages"


Hackaton #1
-----------

Rémy & Alexis are in Rennes, and I am located not far from Dijon - so
we're very close to each other. Closer than from our colleagues from the US
or Canada. When the team was set, we've decided that we would gather for
a couple of days once every month at the Mozilla Paris office to work on tools.

That's what we did this week. And that event is open to the community - we had the pleasure to have
Boris coming and working with us during those 2 days.

We worked on the following topics:

- We released the long overdue Circus 0.11
- We made the Circus web dashboard compatible with several Circus instances.
  In other words, you can now supervise processes that are running on several
  servers from the same dashboard
- We looked at some improvements in how Cornice publishes its APIs
  specifications.

But the most important task: we socialized, had fun around food/drinks.

The next hackaton will be sometimes in June. I'll try to announce it
so more people can join us.
