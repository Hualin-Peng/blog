Title: The UI of my dreams : Firefox / Terminal / Thunderbird unified

I work in three environments the whole day:   
-   Firefox (now mostly Minefield)
-   Linux terminals
-   Thunderbird

*Yeah you can tell I am not good at screenshots ;)*   
  
I switch from one screen to the other using <Alt+Tab\> and the
underlying Operating System does not really matter. While I am under
Ubuntu these days on my MacBook, I'd say that if I had a Bash or ZSH
under Windows or Mac OSX, I would not care that much about the OS --
Well I do because Linux offers the best environment when you develop
server apps but that's not the point--. In the shell, 90% of my windows
are displaying a Vim and most of the time Vim displays itself several
files in split mode.   
  
Every time I switch the context, I have this tiny *ergonomic fracture*
in my head. I try desperately my Vim shortcuts in Firefox. Thanks to
[Vimperator][], I was able to reduce this fracture and I'd love to see
something similar in Thunderbird.   
  
But there's still something Firefox has, I wish I'd find in all my
contexts. Everyone of them has Tabs - But Firefox has ~~TabCandy~~
[Panorama][], which let you organize tabs in space. I'd also like to
["Pin as App"][]some of my terminals, or do something similar in
Thunderbird.   
  
So the UI of my dreams would consist of having the same behavior for
these three environments:   
-   Panorama
-   App Tabs
-   Same shortcuts everywhere (Vim mode for me ;))
-   Eventually, have a Fusion mode where all tabs from all contexts are
    at the same level

  
I don't think it's that crazy and I think that's where we tend to go to
in the future. So, who's in for a Desktop Panorama ?
