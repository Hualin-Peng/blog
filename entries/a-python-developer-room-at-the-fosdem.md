As a young PUG, we've missed the deadline last year. We're in this year
!   
  
The [AFPY][] (Association Francophone Python) organizes this year, at
[the annual FOSDEM conference][] (24/25 February, Brussels, Belgium) a
Python Developer Room.   
  
The room schedule can be followed here:

A lot of interesting Python-related conferences (and Zope as well) will
take place, and a few sprints will probably be organized as well.   
  
So if you are in Europe, not attending to [PyCon][], the FOSDEM is the
place to go to !
