I [have announced it already][], and the dates have changed a bit. But
let's say it again since the date is approaching: we will have a sprint
at my house the second week-end of September (17/18), focusing on
packaging and testing (and other topics if people want).   
  
This sprint will be a special event like last year: we will enjoy wines
directly from the producers place (Gevrey-Chambertin anyone ?) and do
some restaurants in the area.   
  
Now its a good time to tell me if you are coming, by adding your name
