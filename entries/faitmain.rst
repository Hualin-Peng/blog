I am at the Fosdem in Bruxelles, trying to recover from last night
beer event - and I should really be doing my slides for my talk, but
I wanted to talk about my new personal project first: http://faitmain.org

**Fait Main** is a french online magazine I have started. It's in some
ways very similar to `Make <http://makezine.com/>`_ : it contains
articles about Raspberry Pi, Arduino, but also some topics around Python,
Food, art in general, and some essays and interviews.

The link between all articles is the `Do It Yourself <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself>`_
approach, and we're trying for each article to present a projet that
combines at least two topics of this list: eletronics, software,
art, food & ecology.

The first issue was released a few days ago, and the next issue is planned in May.

In the first issue we're talking about `CNC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnc>`_,
`Machine Learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>`_, about
Processing.js, Pure-Data and many other things.

The whole website is statically generated using Python & Mako & there's
a Xapian-based search engine driven from Javascript.

Everyone is welcome to participate in the project at every level:
coding, reviews, writing etc. Things are on Github at https://github.com/faitmain.

Content of the first issue :http://www.faitmain.org/auteurs/index.html

Oh I should mention: **everything is in french** ;)
