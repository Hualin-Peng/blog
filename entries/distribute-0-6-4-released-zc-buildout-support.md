Title: Distribute 0.6.4 released - zc.buildout support 
Date: 2009-10-10 22:53
Category: distribute, python, zc.buildout

We've juste released [Distribute 0.6.4][].   
  
This version is now fully compatible with [zc.buildout][], meaning that
you can use Distribute in your buildout transparently as long as you use
our special zc.buildout bootstrap file located here :
[http://nightly.ziade.org/bootstrap.py][].   
  
We've also added in [Jannis' upload\_docs command][], that allows a
project to upload its Sphinx based documentation to PyPI.   
  
As a matter of fact, Distribute is using it now and you can reach its
documentation at : [http://packages.python.org/distribute][].   
  
If you have any feedback, or want to help around, drop us a mail at
[distutils-sig][] or come in our IRC channel in \#distutils (freenode)
