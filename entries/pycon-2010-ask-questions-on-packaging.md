Title: Pycon 2011 - Ask questions on packaging
Date: 2011-03-10 14:03
Category: packaging, pycon, python

30 minutes is very short -- that's the length of my Python talk about
packaging.   
  
In order to give a chance to people that could not make it to Pycon, or
for those who won't be able to ask them during the talk, I have created
a Moderator here: [http://bit.ly/pycon2010][]   
  
Add questions there and vote for them -- I'll answer to them at the end
of the talk if I have spare time, or in my blog.
