We wanted to do this for a while: make the weekly *show and tell* we're
having at Mozilla Services Europe every week a public event anyone can
attend to.

Mozilla Services Europe is composed of Alexis, Hanno and myself.

I've tried to set up a `BigBlueButton <http://www.bigbluebutton.org/>`_ box
in the past but I never found the time to finish setting everything up. Maybe
one day...

In the meantine we used Google Plus Hangout, which gives us the ability to
broadcast live the event on YouTube, and even record it for us. It's hassle-free,
so yay!

The first hangout is composed of two parts:

- at 1"20' starts a round table of current "tool & lib" projects we work on
- at 11"4' demo of Vaurien

tools we discuss during the hangout:

- ZKTools = http://zktools.rtfd.org
- Circus = http://circus.io
- Vaurien = http://vaurien.rtfd.org

The recorded hangout on G+:

Please let us know if you liked it, what was boring or any issue or thing we
can improve.

I will announce the next one as soon as we define a date - probably sometimes
next week on Paris/Berlin time around 10 am.
