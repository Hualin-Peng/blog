I love Packt. As soon as I have told them that some people liked the
book but [complained][] about the typos, they proposed to go ahead and
launch a new print cycle.   
  
Basically it means that the next buyers will have a typo-free book. At
least for all the typos that were [reported on my Trac here,][] or at
Packt's.   
  
I am currently processing all the typos reported at Packt so I have a
full list on my wiki, and will provide them the final list tomorrow.   
  
Then, they will re-print it.   
  
So if you already own the book, and you see a typo that is not listed,
please let me know.
