Title: Distribute sprint has started in D.C. (setuptools, distutils, PyPI)

Just a quick note:   
  
We have started the sprint in D.C. on packaging matters. Our tasks for
the moment:   
-   re-read all the threads in [distutils-ML][] since mid-september.
-   write a short list of actions that can be done NOW in distutils,
    setuptools and PyPI
-   write a short list of writing that can be done to define a "new"
    tool

  
Please, join at any time in \#distutils in freenode, and ping us, if
you want to get involved.
