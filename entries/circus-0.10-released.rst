It took almost 6 months to release the next version of Circus. I am very
proud of this release because a lot of its work was contributed by people
from the community.

Circus is now Python 3 compatible, has a fully asynchronous core and improved
documentation, amongst many many other things: http://circus.readthedocs.org/en/latest/changelog/#id1

I've published a blog post in our Mozilla blog, that interviews three
Circus contributors:
