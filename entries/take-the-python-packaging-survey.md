The [Python Langage Summit][] is coming up. To prepare this event, I
have put online a survey you can take to tell us a bit more about you
and how you package your Python applications.   
-   **Who should take the survey** : any Python developer that packages
    and distributes his code, no matter how.
-   Take the survey: [**http://tinyurl.com/packaging-survey**][]

  
Thanks to all the people that helped building the survey, and a special
thanks to Massimo Di Pierro who created the application that runs the
Survey and helped me set up the survey. It runs under [web2py][].
