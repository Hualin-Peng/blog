in Paris, looks very good.   
  
Extracts:

This is going to be two intense days in Paris, so if you are around,
please join us, it's free.   
  
Paris - [Cité des Sciences et de la Vilette][] - 16/17 May .   
  
The talks will be in french, but the organization team works hard to
have english talks as well next year. Anyway, you don't need to speak
french to join us and have a good time ;)
