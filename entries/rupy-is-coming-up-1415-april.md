Category: conference, python

This conference is a great idea: during two days, Python and Ruby
experts will gather in Poznan, 14/15 april, to talk about their favorite
language !   
  
On Python side we'll have some speaks about:   
-   TurboGears
-   PyPy
-   Django
-   IronPython
-   many other interesting topics

  
On Ruby side, well..just take a look here:
[http://rupy.wmid.amu.edu.pl/?page\_id=15][], as I cannot say anything
about Ruby (yet ;))   
  
I'll have the chance to present a topic about Agile Documentation in
Python, which heavily relies on my previous PyCon tutorial, but will
focus on presenting how we, Python coders, play with doctests and enjoy
it. (doctests, reST, Python, Beer = yepee). I have a few days left to
digg on Ruby side to see how they work with tests and documenting, to
conclude my slides.   
  
There's something I don't understand though, why using Ruby ? Python is
way cooler ! ... ;)   
  
Anyway, I am looking forward to talk to people from the Ruby community
to get an insight, and to see Poland.   
  
**dzie≈Ñ dobry ! **
