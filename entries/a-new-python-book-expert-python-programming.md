The [Packt team][] added [a page about my new book][], which will be out
sometimes in September, so I guess it is the right time for me to
announce it here !   
  
So here comes "Expert Python Programming", where I explain how we work
with Python every day to create software.

This is my first book in English, and writing in another language was
quite challenging ;)   
  
Anyway, this book is intended for developers that already have a
background in Python and covers only advanced topics ([see the editor
details][]). But as I said, it explains how we develop our applications
in Python so topics like continuous integration, documentation, testing,
releasing, refactoring, etc. are covered.   
Managers will also have a good overview of how a Python project can be
run and managed, using modern tools like Distributed Version Control
Systems (Mercurial for instance) or Buildbot.   
  
Even if I am working on Zope and Plone these days, I have focused on
writing a book that is only about Python, to make it useful to any
developer. The fact that my friend [Shannon][] did the technical
reviewing helped on this : he doesn't use Zope too much so he was close
to the target readership.   
  
I will take more time when it comes out to announce it in the various
mailing lists, and to get into greater details about the content that
will be available online besides the book (some Python packages, etc)   
  
I can't wait to see it out and hold it :D
