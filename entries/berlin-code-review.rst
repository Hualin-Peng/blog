Raising 2500 euros for a charity is hard. That's what I am trying to
do for the Berlin Marathon on `Alvarum <http://www.alvarum.com/tarekziade>`_.

Mind you, this is not to get a bib - I was lucky enough to get one from the
lottery. It's just that it feels right to take the opportunity of this marathon
to raise money for Doctors without Borders. Whatever my marathon result will
be. I am not getting any money out of this, I am paying for all my Marathon
fees. Every penny donated goes to MSF (Doctors without Borders).

It's the first time I am doing a fundraising for a foundation and
I guess that I've exhausted all the potentials donators in my family,
friends and colleagues circles.

I guess I've reached the point where I have to give back something
to the people that are willing to donate.

So here's a proposal: I have been doing Python coding for quite some
time, wrote some books in both English and French on the topic, and
working on large scale projects using Python. I have also gave
a lot of talks in Python conferences around the world.

I am not an expert of any specific fields like scientific Python,
but I am good in "general Python" and in designing stuff that scales.

I am offering one of the following service:

- Python code review
- Slides review
- Documentation review or translation from English to French

The contract (gosh this is probably very incomplete):

- Your project have to be under an open source license, and
  available online.

- I am looking from small reviews, between 30mn and 4 hours
  of work I guess.

- You are responsible for the intial guidance. e.g. explain
  what specific review you want me to do.

- I am allowed to say no (mostly if by any chance I have tons of proposals,
  or if I don't feel like I am the right person to review your code.)

- This is on my free time so I can't really give deadlines - however
  depending on the project and amount of work I will be able
  to roughly estimate how long is going to take and when I should
  be able to do it.

- If I do the work you can't back off if you don't like the
  result of my reviews. If you do without a good reason, this
  is mean and I might cry a little.

- I won't be responsible for any damage or liability done to your project
  because of my review.

- I am not issuing any invoice or anything like that. The fundraising site
  however will issue a classical invoice when you do the donation. I am
  not part of that transaction nor responsible for it.

- Once the work will be done, I will tell you how long it took, and
  you are free to give wathever you think is fair and I will happily accept
  whatever you give my fundraising. If you give 1 euro for 4 hours of work I might
  make a sad face, but I will just accept it.
