The next issue of [The Python Papers][] (2, 4) is now available,
containing my blog entry "[eight tips to start with Python][]", and many
interesting articles, like an introduction to Test-Driven Code
Generation. This article explains, after an introduction to test-driven
development, how to generate skeletons that contains unit tests ready to
run (like ZopeSkel in Plone) . Generated test fixture is a real
advantage in complex frameworks to avoid developers to drop TDD.
