I'm really excited about this: we are organizing a Plone sprint in Paris
in April at [Ingeniweb][] headquarters !   
  
No topics are planned yet because it depends a lot on who will be able
to come. This will be done throughout January.   
  
Please join the project and its mailing list if you are interested:

And do not hesitate to make some topic proposal on it
