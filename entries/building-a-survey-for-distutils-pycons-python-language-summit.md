Title: Building a survey for Distutils (Pycon&#039;s Python Language Summit)

Category: python

I have the opportunity to lead a session at the [Python Language
Summit][] at Pycon.   
  
In order to prepare this event, I am currently building a survey
because we need to know how people use Distutils, what is wrong with it,
and so on...   
  
The draft is here : [http://wiki.python.org/moin/Packaging%20Survey][]
  
  
When it's ready (hopefully soon), I'll post it in a SurveyMonkey-like
system online for people to take it, and synthetize the results, so what
I am saying at the summit reflects hopefully the reality.   
  
If you are a Python developer, an OS packager, come to the
[Distutils-SIG mailing list][] and help us build the best survey
possible !   
  
(while the draft is in a wiki, it's better to discuss the changes in
the mailing list before it is applied)
