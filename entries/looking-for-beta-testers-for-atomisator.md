I am looking for beta testers, interested in customized rss feeds or
email alerts experimentations.   
  
Here's a list of services Atomisator can provide :   
-   You run a project and you would like to receive a daily summary in
    your mailbox on what is being said about it in blogs, tweets, etc
-   You have a list of feeds you want to aggregate, with specific
    filters and you can't manage to do with Yahoo pipes or any tools out
    ther, because it is too specific.
-   You want to annotate entries in a feed with extra information
-   etc..

  
What you get as a beta-tester:   
-   a custom Atomisator configuration that fills your needs
-   I am hosting the service, and you get   
   -   either an url on my server to an xml file you can read in your
        aggregator
    -   either one mail per day

      

  
What you are not getting as a beta tester:   
-   you don't get any guarantee on the output or the reliability, these
    are just experimentations.
-   if it's down I can't promise when it will be up again

  
Let me know by mail if you are interested
