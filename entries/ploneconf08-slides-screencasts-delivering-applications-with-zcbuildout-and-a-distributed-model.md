Title: PloneConf&#039;08 slides + screencasts : delivering applications with zc.buildout and a distributed model

I was totally drowned into some customer projects since I came back from
the Plone Conference. But things are looking better now, so I can take a
bit of time to start blogging about the conference. I'll probably do
three blog posts: this one about my tutorial, the next one about the
conference itself and last, an entry about the sprints.   
  
So I gave a tutorial about zc.buildout. The length was a bit
challenging, since I had 90 minutes. Enough time to explain more things
than in a regular talk, but not enough time to get into great details,
as a tutorial should be.   
  
The other thing was about the topic: two talks were covering
zc.buildout, Clayton Parker's one and mine. So my goal was to make sure
they were not overlapping too much.   
  
I had the chance to meet Clayton before we both gave our talk, since
the Six Feet Up crew gave me shelter in the house they rented (nicest
guys in the block). Even if we didn't exchange a lot on the slides
themselves, I could figure what Clayton was going to present. So I....
started my slides from scratch two days before my tutorial and worked
carefully on their scope :D   
  
Alex Clark came and backed me up during the talk, since we are working
together one plone.org for months now and since the talk presented the
new plone.org that is coming up.   
  
I think I did quite well during the talk, because we had a pause half
way, and when we started back, the room stayed full ;)   
  
This is the second time I record all the console work in small
screencasts, to avoid live problems, and I think this is the best way to
go if you need to do some demos, so I'll keep on doing it. Plus, it's
nice to provide them to people after the talk.   
  
Anyway, the talk was videotaped so you can to judge by yourself:

And everytime you see a "get the screencast at
[http://ziade.org/ploneconf][]" in there, well get them :)   
  
In detail:   
1.  [Distutils demo][]
2.  [setuptools demo][]
3.  [collective.eggproxy demo][]
4.  [PloneSoftwareCenter installation][]
5.  [collective.dist demo][]
6.  [new.plone.org demo][]
7.  [collective.releaser demo][]
8.  [plone 3 buildout demo][]
9.  [Multiple target releasing demo][]

  
### What's next ?

  
-   We need to finish the work with Alex on plone.org. It's not hard, it
    just takes time, and we both are quit busy in our jobs :)
-   I need to polish collective.releaser and collective.eggproxy. They
    are *brut de fonderie*, and the code suck a bit. If you are using
    them and want to help, or have some feedback/issues, please, pretty
    please, let me know.
