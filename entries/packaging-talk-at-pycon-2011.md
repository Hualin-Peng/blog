I have submitted a talk for Distutils at Pycon U.S. 2011 under the
"Extreme Talks" section. The idea is to do a deep-dive talk on how
Distutils2 works and how to use it in your projects.   
  
Here's the summary of what I am planning to present:   
   -  Distutils2 presentation and goals

        - Framework

        - Command-driven packaging system

    -  Changes from Distutils1

        - R.I.P. setup.py

        - The new metadata fields (PEP 345)

        - versions for your project (PEP 386)

        - PyPI goodies

         - browsing

         - uploading docs

        - What's installed ? what to install ? (PEP 376)

         - The Dependency graph tool

        - Extensibility !

         - commands

         - compilers

    -  Pysetup, one command to rule them all

        - install !

        - remove

        - do other things

    -  Examples

        - Example 1: A simple Distutils2 project

        - Example 2: Porting your project to Distutils2, and keep it working in Distutils/Setuptools/zc.buildout environments. 

       Â - Example 3: Creating and releasing your own commands and compilers

        - Example 4: Developement process made simple with Distutils2
